# SyntaxPT
SyntaxPT is an innovative programming language based on the vocabulary of the Portuguese language, designed to make learning and practicing programming more accessible to native Portuguese speakers. With a simple and intuitive syntax, it is ideal for beginners, educators and enthusiasts who want to explore concepts of logic and software development in their mother tongue.
# Main Features
Syntax in Portuguese:All the keywords, structures and commands are in Portuguese, making the code more natural and easier to understand.

Simple and Educational:Perfect for those just starting to program, especially in educational environments such as schools and introductory courses.

Real-time interpretation:Write and execute code in SyntaxPT directly in the browser with support for a lightweight and functional interpreter.

Flexibility:Support for variables, conditionals, loops, functions and input and output handling.

# Code examples
```JavaScript
variavel nome = "João"
imprimir("Olá, " + nome)

se (nome == "João") {
    imprimir("Bem-vindo, João!")
} senao {
    imprimir("Bem-vindo, visitante!")
}
```
this will identify if the name is 'João', if it is it will print 'hello joao' if not, it will print 'hello visitor'
